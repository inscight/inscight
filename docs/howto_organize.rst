How to Organize an inSCIght Episode
===================================
So maybe you have a great idea for episode of inSCIght.  
Maybe you have realized that the best of having things happen is by doing 
them yourself.  Maybe you just met some really interesting people and 
want to stick them in front of a microphone.  Maybe it is time for 
you to organize an episode!

This document will walk you through the specifics of how to 
successfully organize an episode, and get an awesome 
reputation in the process.

Here is a checklist, for the tl;dr among us:

    #. Acquire Panelists
    #. Secure Episode Date & Number
    #. Make Convore Thread
    #. Make Doodle Event
    #. Send Kickoff Email
    #. Send Gentle Reminder Email
    #. Select Recording Time
    #. Resolve Scheduling Conflicts
    #. Profit

-------------
Gather People 
-------------
At this point, it is assumed that you have an idea for what 
the episode should be about.  Now you need to convince *other*
people to be on the show as well.  We have hard limits 
of 3 people per episode minimum and 4 people per episode max.  

If you know someone(s) who would be interested, feel free to 
invite them.  Otherwise you may lurk through the `stock panelists`_
and `past guests`_ to find the mix of individuals you want.

Once you have the people you want, you'll have to convince one
of the 3-4 panelists to be a moderator (see HOWTO: Moderate).  
It is often easiest for the organizer to also be the moderator.
You can also try to mine past moderators.


-------------------------------
Determine Episode Number & Date
-------------------------------
Once you have it in your mind who you want to be on the show,
you'll need to figure out what the next episode date that 
hasn't been claimed yet is and call 'dibs' on it.  You'll
also need to figure out what this date's episode number is.

To do this, you will have to interface with other inSCIght devs
via the mailing list, convore, email, twitter, blog, etc.


----------------------
Episode Convore Thread
----------------------
Once you have the episode number, go to our 
`public convore group`_ and start a new thread entitled
"Episode {num}: {topic}".  Save the url of this thread.


------------------------------
Episode Scheduling with Doodle
------------------------------
Now go to `doodle`_ and start a new event for this episode.
We typically try to record on Tuesday or Wednesday, so select 
both days for the week that you are given.  Then
select a broad range of times, such as 12:00 - 21:00 UTC-6.

**Remember to enable timezone support!**

Also remember the link to the event scheduling page.


-------------------------------
Send Kickoff Email to Panelists
-------------------------------
Arguably, the most important part of organizing is the email that 
you send to the participants on the show.  Here you'll use those links
we saved from before.

A template for this email is provided below:

    Subject: inSCIght Episode {num}: {topic} Planning

    Body:

    Hello All,

    ``{intro text pertinent to the topic}``
    
    That said, here is an easy checklist for the show:

        * Please review the format document, so that you know what to expect (https://github.com/inscight/inscight/blob/master/docs/format.rst)
        * Please discuss your ideas for the show topics on the convore thread (``{convore link}``)
        * Please fill out the doodle for the show, so that we can nail down a time to record the show (``{doodle link}``)

    Additionally, things I need from everyone are:

        * Let everyone know your skype name.  Mine is ``{skype name}``.
        * A 1 sentence bio blurb, to read on the show.
        * A 3 sentence bio blurb, for the website.

    Lastly, if you plan on using your laptop / computer to call into the show, please use headphones so that we avoid nasty feedback issues.

    Sorry for the wall of text.  Thanks again to everyone for volunteering to do this!

    ``{signature}``

Note that it is your responsibility as an organizer to add everyone's bio blurbs to the repository if they are not already there.


---------------------
Gentle Reminder Email
---------------------
The kickoff email is a great way to start things.  However, people often become 
busy and forget to do things.  Therefore, if not everyone has filled out the doodle
or you can hear crickets chirping on the convore thread, please send a gentle
reminder email to your panelists.  This only needs to be one line and should be
sent the Thursday before a Tuesday recording.


--------------
Time Selection
--------------
Once everyone has filled out the doodle, it is your job to pick 
the final recording time.  You then need to let all of your 
panelists know which time you actually selected!


------------------------------
Resolving Scheduling Conflicts
------------------------------
If not everyone can make the same time, as sometimes happens, it is your job as 
organizer to figure out how to resolve things.  It is your job to determine who
is most important to put on a show.  It is your job to say to the people who can't 
make the time that you selected, "Sorry, better luck next time."  (Be careful not 
to eliminate your moderator though!)

Also, if a panelist has to drop out at the last minute for some reason, it is your job to 
replace them.  If for some reason a show drops to 2 people, you should not record.
Or record a more informal show.


------
Credit
------
Lastly, we at inSCIght understand that you have done an excellent job in organizing.
Therefore you will get super special credit in the show notes as organizing the 
episode.  What more could one want!
