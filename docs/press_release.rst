inSCIght: The Scientific Computing Podcast
==========================================
'inSCIght' is a podcast that focuses on scientific computing in all of its various forms. 
Every week we have a few panelists engage head-to-head on poignant and interesting topics. 

The panelists are drawn from all across the scientific computing community.  From embedded 
systems experts to very high level language gurus, from biologists to nuclear engineers, 
the hosts of inSCIght use computers to solve science and engineering problems everyday. 

This podcast throws people, ideas, and opinions into an audio-blender hoping to educate 
and entice each other and the world.
