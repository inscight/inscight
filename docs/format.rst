inSCIght Scientific Computing Podcast Format
============================================
Episodes have the following format:

    * 1 episode per week,
    * ~20-30 min per episode,
    * 1 take per episode,
    * Panel-like episodes where developers talk about specific topics,
    * Ideally there would be 4 panelists, (4 is a hard max)
    * Panelists should be able to Skype or Evo in,
    * Panelists will rotate based on the discussion topic of the week,  
      (i.e. one can sign up for topics that you want to talk about.)


Episode Flow
------------
1. Intro music, chosen by one of the panelists this week
2. Introductions: Moderator says a little (self-prepared) blurb about each 
   panelist on this week.
3. Field Listener Questions / Comments.  
4. Topics:

    * There will be 1 - 3 topics per episode.  
    * The moderator segues into each topic and lets panelists know when it is 
      their turn initially.
    * Each person gets 1.5 min to speak in the first round.
    * Second and further rounds are limited to a minute.
    * Time may be yielded, etc
    * Timing and order are soft limits

5. Rants/Soapbox: 20 - 30s per person.  May be about anything.
6. Outro music.


Episode Prep (Important!)
-------------------------
1. Check and see if you are slated to speak next week
2. Edit topics:

    * Add sub-topics you want to speak about
    * Give a rough outline of your main points
    * Make sure you bring something new / different / debatable to the discussion

3. Come excited and chatty


Episode Types
-------------
1. Deep cut discussions on a single subject.  Starting from a high level, these 
   discussions won't shy away from digging into the theoretical details.
2. Invited guest episodes.  These are similar to interviews where an invited guest 
   is allowed a certain amount of time (~5 min) at the beginning to talk about 
   their research / project.  Then the remaining panelists jump in and the regular 
   episode flow continues.
3. Topical / Conference episodes.  These will be an overview (prior or post) of a 
   conference.  As such they'll cover a range of topics quickly, while hitting 
   the major themes.  Additionally, current event news would fit in this category.

communicate with them:

    1. Blog
