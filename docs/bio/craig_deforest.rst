Craig DeForest
==============

Short
-----
Craig DeForest is a solar physicist who does a lot of image processing, including computer vision, using imagery from space- and 
ground-based instruments.  He abandoned commercial solutions for Perl/PDL ten years ago and never looked back.

Long
----
Craig DeForest is a solar physicist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, CO.  He has studied the Sun for over 20 years, 
with an emphasis on image processing and data analysis.  He organized and exploited the first science program executed by the SOHO 
spacecraft in the 1990s.  He abandoned the commercial IDL environment in 1999 and has been a developer for PDL ever since, 
contributing the range() operator and PDL::Transform module for coordinate transformations and image resampling.  Application 
work includes SWAMIS, a computer vision code optimized for tracking solar magnetic features, and FLUX, a novel magnetohydrodynamic 
simulation code that uses Perl/PDL as a front end and data conditioning environment.
