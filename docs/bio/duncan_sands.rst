Duncan Sands
============

Short
-----

42 year old ex-Australian mathematician living in Paris, who spends more time
mucking around with LLVM than he should!

Long

Duncan Sands usually works on the mathematics of chaos theory for the Centre
National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), a French research institute.
Currently he is on leave from the CNRS, working for the Dutch financial company
DeepBlueCapital.

He became interested in the LLVM project in 2007 while trying to improve the
quality of code generated by the GCC compiler for programs written in the Ada
programming language.  He is the main developer of the dragonegg project, a GCC
plugin which replaces the GCC optimizers and code generators with LLVM's.

He has a BSc in mathematics and physics from the University of Western
Australia and a PhD, in mathematics, from Cambridge University (England).
Having grown up in Australia, he still isn't quite sure how he ended up living
near Paris with his wife and four children.
