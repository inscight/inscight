Glib Ivashkevych is a PhD student in Institute of Physics and Technology
(Kharkov, Ukraine) who loves Python with a great fervor and uses it to mix
everything (C, CUDA, OpenCL, etc.).  Although he is a theoretical physicist,
most of his time is spent doing numerical simulations of classical and quantum
chaotic systems. A few years ago when he discovered Linux and soon after -
Python, it was such an incredible experience that he never used Windows for
work after that. It's just a matter of doing more in less time.
