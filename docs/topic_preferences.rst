**Anthony Andriano**

    * Anything related to hardware 
    * Circuit design (analog or digital) 
    * Embedded programming (firmware, real time OSes, assembly optimization, semaphores, etc.). 
    * Project management and planning as well.


**Cameron Neylon**

    * Technical advances that relate to data sharing and infrastructure, policy, standards
    * The culture around testing and documentation (and why we're so bad at it). 
    * I'm not much use on detailed technical issues or advances, but more how they interact 
      with the everyday work of scientists.


**Kaitlin Thaney**

    * Big Data
